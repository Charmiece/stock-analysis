# stock-analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to provide a macro to analyze theW dataset of stocks. The original code was refractured in order to try for better results.

This is a comparison of the stocks from 2017 and 2018. The stocks did better overall in 2017 with the exception of TERP. in 2017, the stocks DQ, ENPH, FSLR, and SEDG were very inflated. It would have been extremely unusual to keep those percentages in 2018 also but ENPH stayed in the green. RUN was the only other stock that stayed in the green from 2017 to 2018 going from 5.5% to 84%.

## Summary

The advantage of the refractured code is that it runs faster and improved look.

The disadvantage of the refactured code is with the additional work that was put into this it may not have been cost efficient to update it. 

The advantage of the original and refractured code is that it gives cunsumers a simple way to compare stocks from one year to another or one period to another.

The disadvantage of the original and refractured code is that if someone makes a mistake, the code wouldn't run. That could pose an issue for non-technology savvy clients.
